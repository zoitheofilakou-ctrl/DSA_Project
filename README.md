# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This project demonstrates the implementation, testing, and performance analysis of fundamental **data structures** and **algorithms** in Python.  
It was created as part of the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course at Turku University of Applied Sciences.

## ⚙️ Main Features

- Implementation of core **data structures**:  
  Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables.

- Implementation of key **algorithms**:  
  Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Merge),  
  Searching (Linear, Binary),  
  Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).

- **Testing and validation** using separate test files for each module.  
- **Performance analysis** based on time and space complexity (O-notation).  
- **Comparative evaluation** of sorting and traversal algorithms.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or another IDE.  
3. Run individual tests using Python, for example:

   ```bash
   cd tests
   python test_traversal.py
   python test_array_lists.py
   python test_stack_queue.py

Analysis files can be viewed under the /analysis folder.

📘 Documentation

All documentation and analysis files are located in the /docs and /analysis folders:

docs/report.md → full project documentation

analysis/algorithms_analysis.md → sorting and searching complexity

analysis/traversal_analysis.md → tree traversal complexity

analysis/performance_comparison.md → performance comparison report

🧩 Purpose and Learning Outcomes

This project was developed to:

Understand how fundamental data structures work internally.

Analyze the time and space efficiency of algorithms.

Practice writing modular and testable Python code.

Compare algorithm performance for different input sizes.
